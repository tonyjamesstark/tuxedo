"""Composer: builds the page that Playwright screenshots and the editor previews.

Reads pages from the file-backed ``PageStore``, resolves font references through
the plugin registry, emits ``@font-face`` rules for every loaded font, and
renders one ``<div class="cell">`` per cell.

For plugins that ship a ``server.py``, the composer calls ``fetch()`` and
embeds the result as ``data-data`` on the cell so client.js receives it via
``ctx.data``.

The theme system was stripped in v0.17 to clear the deck for a redesign; cells
no longer carry palette / --theme-* / --c-* tokens.

    URL and a fresh render; unchanged dashboards keep hitting the cached image.

    The render is deliberately kept OFF this request thread: if the image isn't
    cached yet we enqueue a background render and return ``202`` so the client
    falls back to a live iframe meanwhile. Rendering inline would pin a waitress
    worker for up to ~105s while the screenshot self-requests ``/compose``,
    which a burst of hovers could turn into thread starvation.

    ``?refresh=<seconds>`` opts into content freshness for live-status
    consumers (the Lineups screen cards): the token only tracks the page
    DEFINITION, so a dashboard whose data moves (a clock, a feed) would
    otherwise stay frozen at its first render forever. With the param, a
    cached image older than the window is served as-is but queued for a
    background re-render, and caching switches to revalidation (mtime-aware
    ETag, no-cache) so the next poll picks the fresh image up.

    ``?sent=1`` serves the composition actually pushed for this dashboard
    instead of any render, for surfaces that answer "what is on that screen"
    (the Lineups cards). A re-render can never match a dashboard whose output
    moves on its own - a fractal draws differently every time - so re-rendering
    shows something the panel has never displayed. Falls back to the render
    path when the dashboard has never been pushed. A dashboard edited since its
    last push deliberately keeps showing the old frame: that IS what the panel
    is displaying until the next push.
